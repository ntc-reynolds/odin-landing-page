# odin-landing-page

This is my version of The Odin Project's Landing Page project. The goal of the project was to create a simple landing page from a provided design using HTML and CSS.

You can view the design reference images [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png) and [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png), along with a live version of the page at [ntc-reynolds.github.io/odin-landing-page/](https://ntc-reynolds.github.io/odin-landing-page/).
